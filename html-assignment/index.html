        <p><strong><em>Hello!!</em></strong> I am Wirunput S.</p><br>
        <p>I am originally from <abbr title="Thailand">TH.</abbr> I am an <b>Algonquin College</b> student majoring in <em>Interactive Media Design,</em> Level 1. And officially started on September 6<sup>th</sup>,2022. <br>
            My favourite subjects are web development, photography, and digital graphics. Despite the fact that I have no prior experience in this field, I am eager to learn new skills.<br>

      <br>
      After I graduated from college, my goal was to get the best job and company in web design and digital media design. <br>And I have skills in photo editing, lighting,
      and other photography concepts that allow me to create visually appealing works of art as well. <br>However, I have more than 5 years of experience in other areas of
      support, including community management and customer service.</p>
